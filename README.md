## Special Mention
- [Today's rabbit hole: securing JWTs for authentication, httpOnly cookies, CSRF tokens, secrets & more](https://dev.to/petrussola/today-s-rabbit-hole-jwts-in-httponly-cookies-csrf-tokens-secrets-more-1jbp). Since my backend and frontend are on different domains, I had some issues and figured out from this article that I needed to proxy the request. Tutorials I've seen did do this but it was on the create-react-app and I'm using vite, so it didn't work for me.
- [Django & React Web App Tutorial - Authentication, Databases, Deployment & More...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-QsfbznSXI). Even though Django is used here and tokens are stored in localstorage, I mainly looked through the frontend (React) section to get a general idea of how to structure and implement my frontend.
